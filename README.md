## Requesting API Access

To request access, go to the new API Keys section in Users and Access in App Store Connect. Please note that you must be the Team Agent (Legal role) of a development team enrolled as an organization. Access for developers enrolled as an individual is coming soon.

## How to use the SDK?

_Not all endpoints are available yet, we're working hard to implement them all (see [Endpoints](Sources/Endpoints))._

#### 1. Import the framework:

```swift
import AppStoreConnect_Swift_SDK
```

#### 2. Create your API Configuration

Go to [https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/access/integrations/api](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/access/integrations/api) and create your own key. This is also the page to find your private key ID and the issuer ID.

After downloading your private key, you can open the .p8 file containing the private key in a text editor which will show like the following content:

```
-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
FDFDGgEAMBMGByqGSM49AgEGCCqGSM49AwEHBHkwdwQgPaXyFvZfNydDEjxgjUCUxyGjXcQxiulEdGxoVbasV3GgCgYIKomokDj0DAQehRANCAAASffd/DU3TUWAoLmqE6hZL9A7i0DWpXtmIDCDiITRznC6K4/WjdIcuMcixy+m6O0IrffxJOablIX2VM8sHRpoiuy
-----END PRIVATE KEY-----
```

Copy the contents and remove the whitelines, `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----` and `-----END PRIVATE KEY-----`.

Use this private key together with the issuer ID and the private key ID to create your configuration:

#### Organization Developer Account (Standard):
```swift
let configuration = try APIConfiguration(
    issuerID: "<YOUR ISSUER ID>", 
    privateKeyID: "<YOUR PRIVATE KEY ID>", 
    privateKey: "<YOUR PRIVATE KEY>"
)
```

#### Individual Developer Account:
```swift
let configuration = try APIConfiguration(
    individualPrivateKeyID: "<YOUR PRIVATE KEY ID>", 
    individualPrivateKey: "<YOUR PRIVATE KEY>"
)
```

#### Using .p8 file (Organization):
```swift
let configuration = try APIConfiguration(
    issuerID: "<YOUR ISSUER ID>", 
    privateKeyID: "<YOUR PRIVATE KEY ID>", 
    privateKeyURL: URL(fileURLWithPath: "~/AuthKey_<YOUR PRIVATE KEY ID>.p8")
)
```

#### Using .p8 file (Individual):
```swift
let configuration = try APIConfiguration(
    privateKeyURL: URL(fileURLWithPath: "~/AuthKey_<YOUR PRIVATE KEY ID>.p8")
)
```

#### Enterprise Account:
For enterprise accounts, add the `isEnterprise: true` parameter:
```swift
let configuration = try APIConfiguration(
    issuerID: "<YOUR ISSUER ID>", 
    privateKeyID: "<YOUR PRIVATE KEY ID>", 
    privateKey: "<YOUR PRIVATE KEY>",
    isEnterprise: true
)
```

All methods also accept an optional `expirationDuration` parameter that defaults to 20 minutes which is the max duration allowed by the API. You can even omit the `privateKeyID` when using file URLs as it can be inferred from the .p8 filename.

#### 3. Create an APIProvider and perform a request

After creating an `APIProvider` instance with your `APIConfiguration` you can start performing your first request.

```swift
let request = APIEndpoint
    .v1
    .apps
    .get(parameters: .init(
        sort: [.bundleID],
        fieldsApps: [.appInfos, .name, .bundleID],
        limit: 5
    ))
let apps = try await self.provider.request(request).data
print("Did fetch \(apps.count) apps")
```

```swift
let request = EnterpriseAPIEndpoint
    .v1
    .profiles
    .get(parameters: .init(
        sort: [.name]
    ))
let profiles = try await self.provider.request(request).data
print("Did fetch \(profiles.count) profile")
```


### Handling paged responses

If the responses from the API request can be delivered in multiple pages, you can iterate over all of them using an AsyncSequence or individually request the next page following the current one.

```swift
let request = APIEndpoint
    .v1
    .apps
    .get(parameters: .init(
        sort: [.bundleID],
        fieldsApps: [.appInfos, .name, .bundleID],
        limit: 2
    ))

// Demonstration of AsyncSequence result of APIProvider.paged(_)
var allApps: [App] = []
for try await pagedResult in provider.paged(request) {
    allApps.append(contentsOf: pagedResult.data)
}
print("There are \(allApps.count) apps in total")

// Demonstration of APIProvider.request(_:isPagedResponse:) and APIProvider.request(_: pageAfter:)
let firstPageResult = try await provider.request(request)
let firstPageApps = firstPageResult.data
print("The first page of results has \(firstPageApps.count) apps")

if provider.request(request, isPagedResponse: firstPageResult) {
    if let nextPage = try await provider.request(request, pageAfter: firstPageResult) {
        let secondPageApps = nextPage.data
        print("The second page of results has \(secondPageApps.count) apps")
    }
}
```

### Handling errors

Whenever an error is returned from a request, you can get the details by catching the error as follows:

```swift
do {
    print(try await self.provider.request(requestWithError).data)
} catch APIProvider.Error.requestFailure(let statusCode, let errorResponse, _) {
    print("Request failed with statuscode: \(statusCode) and the following errors:")
    errorResponse?.errors?.forEach({ error in
        print("Error code: \(error.code)")
        print("Error title: \(error.title)")
        print("Error detail: \(error.detail)")
    })
} catch {
    print("Something went wrong fetching the apps: \(error.localizedDescription)")
}
```

The error title and detail should help you solve the failure.
For more info regarding errors, see: [Parsing the Error Response Code](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/interpreting_and_handling_errors/parsing_the_error_response_code) as documented by Apple.

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the `swift` compiler. It is in early development, but this SDK does support its use on supported platforms.

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding the SDK as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift`.

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/AvdLee/appstoreconnect-swift-sdk.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "4.0.0"))
]
```

## Development

To help with the development of this repository you need to follow the next steps:

- clone this repository
- run `swift test` to run the tests

### Update OpenAPI generated code

Install [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/):

```bash
brew install jq
```

Run the following:

```bash
$ make update
```

This will attempt to download the App Store Connect [OpenAPI specification](https://developer.apple.com/sample-code/app-store-connect/app-store-connect-openapi-specification.zip) from Apple, and re-run the [CreateAPI](https://github.com/CreateAPI/CreateAPI) generator to produce the updated source code.

Alternatively, you can run `make download` and `make generate` individually.
